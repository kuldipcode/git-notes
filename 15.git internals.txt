Four sub-directories:

hooks/ : example scripts
info/ : exclude file for ignored patterns
objects/ : all "objects"
refs/ : pointers to commit objects

Four files:
HEAD : the current branch
config : configuration options
description
index : staging area 


------------------------------------------------------------------
Subversion
delta storage system
--------------------------
Git
directed acyclic graph (DAG):Storage data structure, A directed acyclic graph or DAG is graph with directed edges and does not form a single cycle if moved in direction of edges.
Objects in GIT: Objects are immutable files stored on disk with hash key as name assigned to them.
.git This folder contain all tracking history of git

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.git/Objects
1. Blob (current snapshot of file on git add)
2. Tree  (directories)
3. Commit (reference to a tree, parent commit, etc.)
4. Tag

----------------------------------------------------------
	find .git/objects -type f
	git show commitA...commitD
	git-show (is a command line utility that is used to view expanded details on Git objects such as blobs, trees, tags, and commits. git-show has specific behavior per object type.)

* 1. Blob contains data in compressed format.
Incase we change test.txt back to blank file new blob will not be created as blob e6 already exist for same.

	echo 'version 1' > test.txt
		git hash-object -w test.txt (Adds to git database and returns commit id which refers obj  )
	echo 'version 2' > test.txt
		git hash-object -w test.txt (Adds to git database returns commit id and writes to git database)
	git cat-file -t SHA-commitId (2+38 digits returns type)
	git cat-file -p SHA-commitId (2+38 digits returns content of commited file)

* 2. Tree
	“If blob is a file; then tree is a directory”.
	git tree gets created when we use git commit command.
	explicitly create a tree using command git write-tree.(will generate root tree)
	  
	git write-tree (to write the staging area out to a tree object.)

	git cat-file -p master^^{tree}.
		In CMD on Windows, the ^ character is used for escaping, so you have to double it to avoid this: git cat-file -p master^^{tree}. 
		When using PowerShell, parameters using {} characters have to be quoted to avoid the parameter being parsed incorrectly: git cat-file -p 'master^{tree}'.

* 3. commit object stores information about who saved the snapshots, when they were saved, or why they were saved.

Commit has two pointers:
1. First pointer points to root tree
2. Second pointer points to older commit.

every new commit we will have new root tree.

echo 'First commit' | git commit-tree d8329f (To create a commit object, you call commit-tree and specify a single tree SHA-1 and which commit objects, if any, directly preceded it. )

git log --stat 1a410e

* 4. tag

git cat-file -p 70460b4b4aece5915caf5c68d12f560a9fe3e4
