objects/ : all "objects"
refs/ : pointers to commit objects
Four files:

HEAD : the current branch
config : configuration options
description

Here "object" includes:

blobs (files)
trees (directories)
commits (reference to a tree, parent commit, etc.)

Subversion
delta storage system

Git
directed acyclic graph (DAG):Storage data structure, A directed acyclic graph or DAG is graph with directed edges and does not form a single cycle if moved in direction of edges.
Objects in GIT: Objects are immutable files stored on disk with hash key as name assigned to them.
.git This folder contain all tracking history of git

.git/Objects
1.Blob: current snapshot of file on git add
2.Tree
3. Commit
4. Tag

1. Blob contains data in compressed format.
Incase we change test.txt back to blank file new blob will not be created as blob e6 already exist for same.
2. Tree
“If blob is a file; then tree is a directory”.
git tree gets created when we use git commit command.
explicitly create a tree using command git write-tree.(will generate root tree)
3. commit
Commit has two pointers:
1. First pointer points to root tree
2. Second pointer points to older commit.
every new commit we will have new root tree.
4. tag
