they fork the official repository to create a copy of it on the server. 
This new copy serves as their personal public repository—no other developers are allowed to push to it, but they can pull changes from it

When they're ready to publish a local commit, they push the commit to their own public repository—not the official one. 
Then, they file a pull request with the main repository, 
which lets the project maintainer know that an update is ready to be integrated.

-----
1. A developer 'forks' an 'official' server-side repository. This creates their own server-side copy.

2. The new server-side copy is cloned to their local system.

3. A Git remote path for the 'official' repository is added to the local clone.

4. A new local feature branch is created.

5. The developer makes changes on the new branch.

6. New commits are created for the changes.

7. The branch gets pushed to the developer's own server-side copy.

8. The developer opens a pull request from the new branch to the 'official' repository.

9. The pull request gets approved for merge and is merged into the original server-side repository
