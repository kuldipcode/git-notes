git config --global user.email "kuldip.code@gmail.com"

* Git basic commands
git checkout -b dev (create new branch locally)
git status (check untracked (red) and tracked (green) files)
git add firstfile.txt (cash and index files)
git commit -m "initial commit"  (creates commit object and id )

git clone https://github.com/kuldipcode/git-notes.git
	or
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/kuldipcode/c12-driessen-model.git 
git branch -M main (The -M <Branch> command renames the specified upstream branch from the old name (master) to the new name (main))
git push -u origin main (publish main local branches to remote)
git push --all -u (publish all local branches to remote)

* delete remote and local branches
git push origin --delete bad-branch-name (delete remote branch)
git branch -D branch (delete local branch)

git log (gives history of commits)
git log --stat 1a410e (log detail about specific commit )

* When downloading content from a remote repo: git pull and git fetch command

git fetch ( updates your remote-tracking branches under refs/remotes/<remote>/. 
This operation is safe to run at any time since it never changes any of your local branches under refs/heads.)

git diff main origin/main

git checkout main
git merge origin/main (git pull run this automatically)

If you have local changes on your master that aren't reflected on origin, you might want git rebase origin/master to make sure your commits are 'on top'

git pull ( is the more aggressive alternative; it will download the remote content for the active local branch and immediately execute git merge to create a merge commit for the new remote content. 
If you have pending changes in progress this will cause conflicts and kick-off the merge conflict resolution flow.)
