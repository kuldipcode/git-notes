Git hooks are scripts that run automatically every time a particular event occurs in a Git repository. 
They let you customize Gitâ€™s internal behavior and trigger customizable actions at key points in the development life cycle.

Common use cases for Git hooks include 
encouraging a commit policy, 
altering the project environment depending on the state of the repository
implementing continuous integration workflows. 
automate or optimize virtually any aspect of your development workflow.
